# Week-3-Assingment

Added relevant HTML elemtents linked them to JS. (nice and easy)

Added cookieCount and cps and gave them values. (also easy)

Created the setInterval function to add a cookie every one second. Updated the DOM so that the "Cookies Collected" and "CPS" would be displayed on screen.
Added ability for saving in local storage using localStorage.setItem. Also used localStorage.getItem so if page was refreshed the count would continue unless cleared manually. (Used yesterdays workshop to help me out with all this)

Gave the cookieImage an event listener so that when clicked it would increas the count by plus 1.
