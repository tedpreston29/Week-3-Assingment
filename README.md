# Week-3-Assingment

18/09/2025
Added relevant HTML elemtents linked them to JS. (nice and easy)

Added cookieCount and cps and gave them values. (also easy)

Created the setInterval function to add a cookie every one second. Updated the DOM so that the "Cookies Collected" and "CPS" would be displayed on screen.
Added ability for saving in local storage using localStorage.setItem. Also used localStorage.getItem so if page was refreshed the count would continue unless cleared manually. (Used yesterdays workshop to help me out with all this)

Gave the cookieImage an event listener so that when clicked it would increas the count by plus 1.

Created async function to .await fetch the ShopUpgrades from the API

Added shop container class so When it comes to styling it wil be easier to have them grouped

Added a forEach loop for the upgrades.

Brain stopped working and struggled to get new shop item elemtents on screen. Tomorrows job I think.

got the shop items displayed on screen using my forEach loop, document.createElement and appendChild. Also added a button to each using the same type of method.

I will add button functionality next to increase and decrease the the cps and cookieCount based on user interaction... Wish me luck connor...
